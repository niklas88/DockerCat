Totally Useless Dockerized Cat
==============================

Build with: `docker build -t dockercat .`

Run with: `echo 'Hello World, from DockerCat' | docker run -i dockercat`

By the way in a quick test dockercat was only 500 times slower than /bin/cat,
also for other commandline apps you may want to use `docker run -it` to get
a pseudo tty
